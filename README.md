This is a C program which models a runoff election. https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/runoff/

The system modelled is a reiterative voting system, whereby rounds of voting continue (with or without elimination) until one candidate achieves a majority, also called repeated balloting

This was produced as a part of CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science. Uploading of my solution to Github is considered to be reasonable regarding the academic honesty policy. (https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/63235w/is_this_reasonable/)

*NOTE* The skeleton of the program was completed, with me completing the implementation of the following functions;
- vote
- tabulate
- print_winner
- find_min
- is_tie
- eliminate


How it works
TO BE FILLED.
